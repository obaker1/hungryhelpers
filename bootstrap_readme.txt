Hungry Helpers Bootstrap Documentation

A Bootstrap Studio template was used to create the dashboard and navigation features to be integrated into the web app.
Additions made from the base template include the map, notifications, and tickets pages, as well as modal elements
displaying pertinent information across pages to meet the needs of a convenient dashboard.
Currently these pages do not serve any functionality beyond being navigable, this is to be remedied in future iterations.
The HTML files rely on various JavaScript and CSS files for their function, currently these pages can be viewed and
navigated in a web browser locally if the entire hungry_helper_bootstrap folders is downloaded.
